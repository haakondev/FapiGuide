# FAPI Guide (Community + Personal Notes)

> This guide is a compilation of the game community’s accumulated knowledge and my own experience.  
> Thank you to everyone who shared information or advice while I was doing my first run.

FAPI is a big game with many mechanics. I’m keeping this guide short, so I won’t always explain *why* I recommend certain things. For more detail, check in-game help. If you need more advice, ask in the official Discord. If you don’t understand an abbreviation, check **Abbreviations** at the end.

## A0: Your First Ascension

### First Reincarnation

#### Potatoes & Skulls
Put points evenly. It will be automated soon anyway.

#### Equipment
- Equip items that have a better **item rating** than what you are currently wearing.
- Delete everything else.
- Each new area will have better drops.

#### Class Talent Tree
Put points into useful talents like potato, skull, attack, HP.

#### Daily Quests
One of the best sources of souls. Very important to do them every day.

#### Whack
Early on, focus on raising your best score by buying upgrades on the first page. Skip everything else.

---

## Farm

Plants give you **HPotatoes** (healthy potatoes). When you have enough, you can reset your farm to get **fries**. Spend fries on upgrades.

### Basic farm layout
- 1 of each plant
- Fill the rest with the highest tier plant
- This is the easiest strategy and is enough to keep your farm up to date through the whole game

### Reset timing
- Do your **first reset right away**
- Do the next **3 resets** when you have enough fries to afford the next **auto plot** plus a bit of other upgrades in the fries shop
- After that, reset when:
  - you can get **10x** more fries than your total, **or**
  - it has been **5 days** since the last reset

### Plant Boost Corner
- Buy upgrades right after they become available
- Until you buy **Auto Buy improvement** (unlocks after **1000+ fries**) you must buy **Plant efficiency** manually
- While running a farm, do not spend more than **~20%** on Plant efficiency upgrades (it makes your plant weaker)
- Before each reset, buy as many upgrades as you can
- After you get **Auto Buy improvement**, you can stop doing this altogether

### French Fries Corner priorities
**Auto > Assembly > Contagion > Protein > Grasshopper > Harvest > Fries > HPotatoes > Fries Healthy Bonus > Keep plot**

> In **Unique French Fries Corner** (4th page) you generally don’t want to spend more than **~10%** of your fries on reset upgrades, as it slows overall farm growth. Spend the rest in the common **French Fries Corner** (3rd page).

---

## Confection
Spread poop evenly, but put **2x less** into **crit** and **evade**.

---

## Souls Shop

> Discord has a list of all codes. Most give souls. Use them to boost early progression.  
> Use the **Daily** code every day to get **500 souls**.

### Souls purchase priorities

#### A0+
- Auto Whack Auto (10K)
- Equipment Auto Recycle (10K)
- Kepo Ball (10K, after you unlock pets)

#### A1+
- Auto Whack Minimum (10K)
- Whack All Day (10K)

#### A2+
- Auto Material Conversion (10K)

#### A3+
- Golden Clover 1 (10K)

#### A5+
- Phoenix (15K)
- Reclaimer (15K)

#### A10+
- Golden Clover 2 (20K)

> When you reach **A10, A15, A20, A25, etc**, **Golden Clover is ALWAYS the first item** you get the latest tier for.

#### A12+
- Adds banners 1 or 2 (20K + 40K)  
Only if you have maxed out Golden Clover

#### A14+
- Old clock (15K)  
Very important for cards and overall progression

#### A15+
- Golden Clover 3 (30K)

#### A20+
- Golden Clover 4 (40K)
- Old Tablette 1 (20K)

#### A25+

#### A45+
- Golden Clover 9 (40K)

#### A50+
- Golden Clover 10 (40K)

#### A60+
- Golden Clover 11 (40K)

After clover (or once you have enough souls to cover 11 clovers), focus on **SWP** and then **SKP**.

### Area progression rule
When you reach **wave 100** in your current area, switch to the next area.

### Reincarnation rule
Reincarnate as soon as you are ready. Choose the **Freeloader** class.

---

## RL 0 to RL 1249

### Classes
Freeloader is your best friend. He is good at farming equipment, and that will always drive progress.

Every other class at this point is mainly for boosting max class levels and challenges.

> Each 100 levels gives 1 talent point for every class.

---

## RP Shop (Reincarnation Points)

### RL 0
**HS > Stats > Area Auto > Skull auto > Autowhack auto > Potato Auto**

The last four are QoL, so feel free to rearrange.

### RL 100
**Potato & Skull 1 and 2 > Stats > Poop > HS > Potato & Skull 3 > Enhancing material**

### RL 300
**HS > Stats > one larva**  
Skip everything else.

### RL 750
**Attack & HP > Class exp > IR > HS > Residue 1 > Cows 5 > Residue 2 > Cows 15**

---

## Class Talent Tree

### Freeloader
- Get as many **reincarnation exp nodes** as possible
- Rush to them using the shortest point path
- Take **special** after 2 reinc exp, and second one after 4th reinc exp

> Special talent looks like a star and is adjacent to a big stat node.

Move your tree toward **Hoer**. It has strong bonuses in the second part of the tree.

### Other classes
Move toward the Hoer part while collecting as many small **class exp** nodes as possible.

For Harvester doing hard challenges, grab some combat stats along the way, including 1 to 2 crit dmg nodes.

---

## General strategy for progress (RL 0–1249)

### Daily rotation goals
- Do one run a day on each non-freeloader class
- Goal: raise max class level to boost freeloader talents
- Rush to the max area

### Area switching while rushing
Switch manually to a new area each time you reach **wave 50**.

### Active play trick
Click for attack speed bonus at the start of the stage to keep attack speed bonus up constantly.

### Farm briefly at max area
Do not stay long there because each next talent point becomes harder to get.

- In A0: 1 to 2 minutes
- Later: do not spend more than 30 seconds when runs are very fast

### Reincarnation cadence
- Reincarnate on a different class
- When done, switch to freeloader and do remaining runs on him
- Aim for **2 hour reincarnations** to use time multiplier for reinc exp efficiently while updating bonuses for the next run

> This guide assumes relatively active play. You can still follow it more idle by doing longer runs.

### Run structure
1. Rush max area on easy  
   Switch manually each time you hit wave 50  
   This unlocks talents and confections quickly  
2. Still fully complete the last ~3 areas  
3. Switch to medium difficulty  
   Start from the first area that isn’t maxed on medium  
   Max cleared waves in each area give a multiplier to reinc exp  

Until medium unlocks, do the same on easy.

> Be aware of different area scaling. You might clear up to 3–4m before you can fully clear 2–9m, so switch manually to 3–1m if you hit a wall in 2–9m.

### Idle farming segment
- Go AFK until you reach max area or wave (about 10 to 15 minutes)
- Switch to the area you want to farm and stay until about 10 minutes before the run ends
- Generally farm the highest difficulty area you can handle for more skulls, kills per second, and later double worms

Menu -> Statistics -> Run stats shows how fast you complete an area and how much exp, potatoes, and skulls you get per second there.

### What to farm during idle
- Pets are the priority
- If no pets to farm: enhancing materials or best resource-per-second area

If you want to stay in one area, disable area switch auto.

Check the game sometimes to redistribute poop, milk, etc.

---

## Equipment (RL 0–1249)

### Early goals
- First main goal on freeloader: reach **1–9e** and collect a full reinc set of **tier 4**

### Multiple sets strategy
Early on it is good to have multiple sets:

- Main set: worn most of the time
  - Stats that help the run: potatoes, skulls, confection
  - Stats that help long term: milk, residue

- Specialized sets: used briefly then swap back
  - Reinc set: high reinc stat, equip right before reincarnating
  - Whack set: high whack stat, equip when playing whack manually to update max score

Lock specialized sets in stash so you don’t destroy them accidentally.

Try to keep specialized sets 1 tier lower than your main set so you can enhance both.

### Example early armor progression
- 1–9e (T4) main set
- 2–1+e (T4) main set + 1–9e (T4) reinc set (old main)
- 2–4+e (T5) main + 1–9e (T4) reinc
- 2–7+e (T6) main
- 2–9e (T7) main + 3–1+e (T6) whack

### Enhancing
Enhancing costs jump every 10 levels, so enhance to 9, 19, etc.

Use “Compare base” to compare new armor with equipped armor before enhancing.

Do not convert materials until conversion rate improves to at least 2:1, which probably won’t happen in A0.

---

## Whack (details)

### Shop priorities
Talent loadout > finish game duration, gold potato, green potato > material conversion > cow prices

Increase max combo, combo multiplier, and whack point when cheap.

Second page upgrades aren’t important before you can reliably stack bonuses, only buy when very cheap.

Auto whack play (green arrow) is not good early unless you invest heavily. Skip for now.

Auto whack gives 25% of your highest score ever achieved, so after you get it you only need to play manually when you expect a big new max score.

When you get a whack equipment set, use it every time you play manually. After that, once per day is fine when you get new armor.

---

## Challenges

Challenges massively boost progress. Do them as soon as you meet requirements:

- C1: Total class levels 3500+ (use Smasher)
- C2: Total class levels 5000+ (Smasher)
- C3: Total class levels 6000+ (Smasher)
- C4: Total class levels 7000+ (Smasher)
- C5: Total class levels 12000+ and RL 900+ (Harvester)
- C6: Total class levels 12000+ and RL 900+ (Rancher)

### Infinite challenges (2nd page)
Labor challenges make areas autocomplete in future reincarnations.

- Do labor challenges when you expect to raise starting area significantly
- You can continue reincarnation after giving up or completing any challenge
- During labor: give up as soon as you reach max possible wave and die, it won’t get better

---

## Cow Factory

### Milk
- Keep about 2 to 10x more milk in attack than HP (HP is easier to get)
- When you unlock potato and class exp, put a little there for healthy bonus, but mainly focus attack and HP

---

## A0 Residue Shop

Page 1 priority:
reinc exp > extra potatoes > auto skull > enhancing materials > whack and healthy potatoes max > double larva > auto potato > material conversion

> Page 2 in A0 is not worth it because it resets on ascension.

---

## Pets (A0)

Starting from 3–2 you can get a pet on kill. Farming pets during idle parts of each run should be a priority.

### Pet priorities to farm
3–2 (Cocorico and Rico) > 3–5 (Vidar) > 3–6 (Primfeet) > 3–7 (Hiko)

Pets level slowly early, so if you get 3–5 it might be better to start using it in the next ascension because pet levels reset.

### Difficulty selection rule
Most important factor is kills per minute.
Higher difficulty often gives more waves per area and restarts less, but if you kill much slower it might be worse. Check the stat page.

> Do not spend pet tokens yet. Very rare currency, important later for hard-to-get pets.  
> Potato skins are less rare but do not spend them yet either.

---

## RL 1250+

### RP
- RL 1250: Potato & Class exp > class exp exponent > HS > Milk 5 / Brewing 5 > Worm > Milk 10 / Brewing 10
- RL 2000: Boiled potato 2 > Reinc

Buy more if you have spare points, but you should be ascending in a few reincarnations anyway.

### Class talent tree (Freeloader)
After you get 3000 points with every class, the second part unlocks and contains a key talent: **Residue**.

Goal: get 2 residue points with as many reinc points as possible.

Required totals:
- 620 points to get 1 residue with 6 reinc
- 755 points to get 2 residue with 7 reinc

On the way, the best small-point bonus is in Hoer part of the tree (class exp).

### Other classes (RL 1250+)
- Get both big class exp nodes in Hoer as soon as possible
- Finish normal exp class nodes
- Harvester: more combat stats
- Other classes: right path of Farmer multibonus tree for more class exp
- Remaining talents are flexible

---

## Path Challenges
Unlock at 3–2–50.

- Start daily run on every class with a path challenge
- Aim for at least +1 area per day
- When done, give up and continue as a normal run
- Sometimes you farm a bit for stats, but don’t spend too long

Harvester and Rancher path challenge bonuses make other classes easier, so start rotation with them.

---

## Confection and Larva tips (RL 1250+)

- Put poop where it helps most for what you are doing now
- Challenge run: you won’t need reinc, drop, IR
- Starting a 2h RL run: prioritize stats to push
- Otherwise: spread poop evenly, because confection levels multiply reinc exp

Larva is similar but strategic because you can’t remove it.

- Attack and HP are capped at 50 levels per second and easy to reach
- Do not put larva into attack or HP

> If you don’t want to think about it, spreading both evenly is still fine.

Use “%” in save slots to quickly split poop:
Example: save 10% and later clicking it divides your poop by 10 for easy spreading.

---

## Ascension: A1

After RL 2000 and challenge 8, you’ll reach ascension quickly. Ascend as soon as you can.

### Checklist before first ascension
- Spend all residue on first page upgrades
- Update whack score with a new whack set

### Ascension perks priority (A1)
Depends on farm development, but generally:
STA (Skull Take Away) > PTA (Potato Take Away)
